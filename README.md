**Three different changes to improve user experience**
1.  Instead of using dynamic playerIds to track players(this is in-efficient), a user login should be created so that;

    - etc
2.  Users should be able to create matches and invite other players via emails or related method
3.  A public leaders board api to improve competition among players
